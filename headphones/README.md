## Overview
This project involved building a responsive webpage using HTML and CSS. The layout adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Key Learnings

- Mistakes are part of the process. I learned a lot through trial and error.
- This project reflects two months of practice, and Iâ€™m proud of the progress Iâ€™ve made.

## Responsive Design
- **Desktop:** `max-width: 1000px`
- **Tablet:** `max-width: 796px`
- **Mobile:** `max-width: 400px`

## Tools & Techniques
- **HTML Semantics** for clean structure
- **CSS** for styling and layout
